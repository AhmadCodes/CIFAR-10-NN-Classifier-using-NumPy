Code run instructions:

- a folder named 'cifar-10-batches-py' should be present in the current directory of the code. this folder contains the pickled files of the CIFAR-10 batches
- open the code and click run.
- sit back and relax. No need to constantly monitor the training progress as the code will output a beeping sound when its over.
- use prediction() function to make prediction. ( for speed, its better to input a whole matrix of size (m x n) where n is the number of features and m is the number of examples.
- please view doc-strings and comments in the program for further and more accurate details.
